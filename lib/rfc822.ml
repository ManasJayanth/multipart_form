   5. Use of encoded-words in message headers

   (2) An encoded-word may appear within a comment delimited by "(" and ")",
   i.e., wherever a "ctext" is allowed. More precisely, the RFC 822 ABNF
   definition for "comment" is amended as follows:

   comment = "(" *(ctext / quoted-pair / comment / encoded-word) ")"

   A "Q"-encoded encoded-word which appears in a comment MUST NOT contain the
   characters "(", ")" or DQUOTE encoded-word that appears in a "comment" MUST
   be separated from any adjacent encoded-word or "ctext" by linear-white-space.

   7. Conformance

   A mail reading program claiming compliance with this specification must be
   able to distinguish encoded-words from "text", "ctext", or "word"s, according
   to the rules in section 6, anytime they appear in appropriate places in
   message headers. It must support both the "B" and "Q" encodings for any
   character set which it supports. The program must be able to display the
   unencoded text if the character

   From RFC 2047

   Update from RFC 1522: + clarification: an 'encoded-word' may appear
   immediately following the initial "(" or immediately before the final ")"
   that delimits a comment, not just adjacent to "(" and ")" *within* *ctext.

   Each header field can be viewed as a single, logical line of ASCII
   characters, comprising a field-name and a field-body. For convenience, the
   field-body portion of this conceptual entity can be split into a
   multiple-line representation; this is called "folding". The general rule is
   that wherever there may be linear-white-space (NOT simply LWSP-chars), a CRLF
   immediately followed by AT LEAST one LWSP-char may instead be inserted. Thus,
   the single line

   To: "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @Org>, JJV @ BBN

   can be represented as:

   To: "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>, JJV@BBN

   and

   To: "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd@ Org>, JJV @BBN

   and

   To: "Joe & J. Harvey" <ddd @ Org>, JJV @ BBN

   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation of a
   header field to its single line represen- tation is called "unfolding".
   Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately followed by a
   LWSP-char as equivalent to the LWSP-char.

   Note: While the standard permits folding wherever linear- white-space is
   permitted, it is recommended that struc- tured fields, such as those
   containing addresses, limit folding to higher-level syntactic breaks. For
   address fields, it is recommended that such folding occur between addresses,
   after the separating comma.

   From RFC 2822

   White space characters, including white space used in folding (described in
   section 2.2.3), may appear between many elements in header field bodies.
   Also, strings of characters that are treated as comments may be included in
   structured field bodies as characters enclosed in parentheses. The following
   defines the folding white space (FWS) and comment constructs.

   Strings of characters enclosed in parentheses are considered comments so long
   as they do not appear within a "quoted-string", as defined in section 3.2.5.
   Comments may nest.

   There are several places in this standard where comments and FWS may be
   freely inserted. To accommodate that syntax, an additional token for "CFWS"
   is defined for places where comments and/or FWS can occur. However, where
   CFWS occurs in this standard, it MUST NOT be inserted in such a way that any
   line of a folded header field is made up entirely of WSP characters and
   nothing else.

   FWS = ([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) / ; Folding white space obs-FWS

   In the obsolete syntax, any amount of folding white space MAY be inserted
   where the obs-FWS rule is allowed. This creates the possibility of having two
   consecutive "folds" in a line, and therefore the possibility that a line
   which makes up a folded header field could be composed entirely of white
   space.

   local-part = word *("." word) ; uninterpreted ; case-preserved

   The local-part of an addr-spec in a mailbox specification (i.e., the host's
   name for the mailbox) is understood to be whatever the receiving mail
   protocol server allows. For exam- ple, some systems do not understand mailbox
   references of the form "P. D. Q. Bach", but others do.

   This specification treats periods (".") as lexical separators. Hence, their
   presence in local-parts which are not quoted- strings, is detected. However,
   such occurrences carry NO semantics. That is, if a local-part has periods
   within it, an address parser will divide the local-part into several tokens,
   but the sequence of tokens will be treated as one uninter- preted unit. The
   sequence will be re-assembled, when the address is passed outside of the
   system such as to a mail pro- tocol service.

   For example, the address:

   First.Last@Registry.Org

   is legal and does not require the local-part to be surrounded with
   quotation-marks. (However, "First Last" DOES require quoting.) The local-part
   of the address, when passed outside of the mail system, within the
   Registry.Org domain, is "First.Last", again without quotation marks.

   From RFC 2822

   local-part = dot-atom / quoted-string / obs-local-part obs-local-part = word
   *("." word)

   6.2.1. DOMAINS

   A name-domain is a set of registered (mail) names. A name- domain
   specification resolves to a subordinate name-domain specification or to a
   terminal domain-dependent string. Hence, domain specification is extensible,
   permitting any number of registration levels.

   Name-domains model a global, logical, hierarchical addressing scheme. The
   model is logical, in that an address specifica- tion is related to name
   registration and is not necessarily tied to transmission path. The model's
   hierarchy is a directed graph, called an in-tree, such that there is a single
   path from the root of the tree to any node in the hierarchy. If more than one
   path actually exists, they are considered to be different addresses.

   The root node is common to all addresses; consequently, it is not referenced.
   Its children constitute "top-level" name- domains. Usually, a service has
   access to its own full domain specification and to the names of all top-level
   name-domains.

   The "top" of the domain addressing hierarchy -- a child of the root -- is
   indicated by the right-most field, in a domain specification. Its child is
   specified to the left, its child to the left, and so on.

   Some groups provide formal registration services; these con- stitute
   name-domains that are independent logically of specific machines. In
   addition, networks and machines impli- citly compose name-domains, since
   their membership usually is registered in name tables.

   In the case of formal registration, an organization implements a
   (distributed) data base which provides an address-to-route mapping service
   for addresses of the form:

   person@registry.organization

   Note that "organization" is a logical entity, separate from any particular
   communication network.

   A mechanism for accessing "organization" is universally avail- able. That
   mechanism, in turn, seeks an instantiation of the registry; its location is
   not indicated in the address specif- ication. It is assumed that the system
   which operates under the name "organization" knows how to find a subordinate
   regis- try. The registry will then use the "person" string to deter- mine
   where to send the mail specification.

   The latter, network-oriented case permits simple, direct, attachment-related
   address specification, such as:

   user@host.network

   Once the network is accessed, it is expected that a message will go directly
   to the host and that the host will resolve the user name, placing the message
   in the user's mailbox.

   6.2.2. ABBREVIATED DOMAIN SPECIFICATION

   Since any number of levels is possible within the domain hierarchy,
   specification of a fully qualified address can become inconvenient. This
   standard permits abbreviated domain specification, in a special case:

   For the address of the sender, call the left-most sub-domain Level N. In a
   header address, if all of the sub-domains above (i.e., to the right of) Level
   N are the same as those of the sender, then they do not have to appear in the
   specification. Otherwise, the address must be fully qualified.

   This feature is subject to approval by local sub- domains. Individual
   sub-domains may require their member systems, which originate mail, to
   provide full domain specification only. When permitted, abbrevia- tions may
   be present only while the message stays within the sub-domain of the sender.

   Use of this mechanism requires the sender's sub-domain to reserve the names
   of all top-level domains, so that full specifications can be distinguished
   from abbrevi- ated specifications.

   For example, if a sender's address is:

   sender@registry-A.registry-1.organization-X

   and one recipient's address is:

   recipient@registry-B.registry-1.organization-X

   and another's is:

   recipient@registry-C.registry-2.organization-X

   then ".registry-1.organization-X" need not be specified in the the message,
   but "registry-C.registry-2" DOES have to be specified. That is, the first two
   addresses may be abbrevi- ated, but the third address must be fully
   specified.

   When a message crosses a domain boundary, all addresses must be specified in
   the full format, ending with the top-level name-domain in the right-most
   field. It is the responsibility of mail forwarding services to ensure that
   addresses conform with this requirement. In the case of abbreviated
   addresses, the relaying service must make the necessary expansions. It should
   be noted that it often is difficult for such a service to locate all
   occurrences of address abbreviations. For exam- ple, it will not be possible
   to find such abbreviations within the body of the message. The "Return-Path"
   field can aid recipients in recovering from these errors.

   Note: When passing any portion of an addr-spec onto a process which does not
   interpret data according to this stan- dard (e.g., mail protocol servers).
   There must be NO LWSP-chars preceding or following the at-sign or any
   delimiting period ("."), such as shown in the above examples, and only ONE
   SPACE between contiguous <word>s.

   6.2.3. DOMAIN TERMS

   A domain-ref must be THE official name of a registry, network, or host. It is
   a symbolic reference, within a name sub- domain. At times, it is necessary to
   bypass standard mechan- isms for resolving such references, using more
   primitive information, such as a network host address rather than its
   associated host name.

   To permit such references, this standard provides the domain- literal
   construct. Its contents must conform with the needs of the sub-domain in
   which it is interpreted.

   Domain-literals which refer to domains within the ARPA Inter- net specify
   32-bit Internet addresses, in four 8-bit fields noted in decimal, as
   described in Request for Comments #820, "Assigned Numbers." For example:

   [10.0.3.19]

   Note: THE USE OF DOMAIN-LITERALS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED. It is permitted
   only as a means of bypassing temporary system limitations, such as name
   tables which are not complete.

   The names of "top-level" domains, and the names of domains under in the ARPA
   Internet, are registered with the Network Information Center, SRI
   International, Menlo Park, California.

   The message identifier (msg-id) is similar in syntax to an angle-addr
   construct without the internal CFWS.

   From RFC 5322

   msg-id = [CFWS] "<" id-left "@" id-right ">" [CFWS]

   Update: + Removed no-fold-quote from msg-id. Clarified syntax

   The message identifier (msg-id) itself MUST be a globally unique identifier
   for a message. The generator of the message identifier MUST guarantee that
   the msg-id is unique. There are several algorithms that can be used to
   accomplish this. Since the msg-id has a similar syntax to addr-spec
   (identical except that quoted strings, comments, and folding white space are
   not allowed), a good method is to put the domain name (or a domain literal IP
   address) of the host on which the message identifier was created on the
   right-hand side of the "@" (since domain names and IP addresses are normally
   unique), and put a combination of the current absolute date and time along
   with some other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on
   the system (for example, a process id number) on the left-hand side. Though
   other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED that the right-hand side
   contain some domain identifier (either of the host itself or otherwise) such
   that the generator of the message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of
   the left-hand side within the scope of that domain.

   Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the msg-id; the
   msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket characters. *)
